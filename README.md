Smart_Mobility_Service (lab-based)

Week_3.   
in this week, we learned how to push any files to our github repository through terminal.  
I pushed files to the main branch as well as two other branches master and master1. 

I used these instructions for pushing my files to a remote GitHub repository by terminal.  

sudo apt-get install git-all -y.    
mkdir directory.     
touch file.      
cd project_folder.     
git checkout (-b) local-branch-name (optinoal).    
git status.     
git init.    
git add .    
git commit -m "VER1" (git commit --amend).    
git remote set-url (or add) origin https://token@github.com/-----.git.    
(git pull or fetch origin main if necessary).    
git push (-u) origin main.    

Actually, after some initial failures to push code to the main branch for the first time, I used git push --force origin main command which worked fine in my case. <br> And later, I could add an additional file to the main branch using git push origin main.
